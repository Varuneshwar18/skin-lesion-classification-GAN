\# GAN Module – Synthetic Skin Lesion Generation



This module documents the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

used to generate synthetic skin lesion images for data augmentation.



\## Overview

A GAN consisting of a Generator and a Discriminator was trained

offline to produce realistic skin lesion images. The generated

images were used to address class imbalance in the dataset.



\## Notes

\- The GAN training process was executed separately.

\- Trained weights and full training scripts are not included due

&nbsp; to computational and storage constraints.

\- Sample synthetic images are provided in the main repository.



This folder focuses on documenting the GAN architecture used

in the project.
